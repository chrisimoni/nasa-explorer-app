[**View in Postman**](YOUR_POSTMAN_DOCUMENTATION_LINK_HERE)

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the NASA Explorer App locally.

---

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or higher recommended)
- npm or Yarn

---

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrisimoni/nasa-explorer-app
cd nasa-explorer-app
```

---

## Environment Variables

Both the **frontend** and **backend** require environment variables to function correctly.

---

### üîß 1. Backend

Rename the sample file:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your NASA API key from [https://api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov):

```env
PORT=3000
NASA_API_KEY=YOUR_NASA_API_KEY_HERE
NASA_BASE_URL=https://api.nasa.gov
NODE_ENV=development
CACHE_DURATION_SECONDS=3600
```

---

### üñº 2. Frontend

Rename the sample file:

```bash
cd ../frontend
cp .env.sample .env
```

Update the API URL if needed:

```env
BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1
```

---

## Backend Setup

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend server should now be running at:  
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Running Tests

To run unit and integration tests for the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm run test
```

This will execute all test suites and display the results in your terminal.

## Frontend Setup

Install dependencies and start the Vite development server:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend app should now be running at:  
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

---

## Running the Application

To run both the backend and frontend:

1. Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend app:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at:  
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
